Contains data and setups for bioexcel-related SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019) virus simulations

The Corona pandemic has made it painfully clear that despite advances in science and technology, virus outbreaks still form an enormous threat to society. Until a vaccine becomes available, post-exposure protection with anti-viral drugs is our best option to minimize the devastating effects of the outbreak, without the negative societal impact of lockdowns. Developing or repurposing such anti-virals is thus a race against the clock and many groups have fortunately taken up this challenge. To contribute to these world-wide efforts, we opened up a repository for sharing structures, topologies and simulation parameters of Corona virus proteins in this repository. We also include complexes with anti-viral drugs and other proteins that can serve as starting points for computational screening and other simulations approaches aimed at inhibiting these proteins. We encourage our colleagues to also contribute their input files to speed up this joint effort at slowing down the current  outbreak and prevent future outbreaks.
